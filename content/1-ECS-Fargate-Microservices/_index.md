This project implements a **fully automated and secure microservices deployment platform** on AWS, using **ECS Fargate** as the container orchestration engine and **Terraform** as the Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool.
The goal is to build a **production-ready architecture** that is **scalable, cost-optimized, and security-hardened**, while enabling rapid and reliable application delivery through a complete **CI/CD pipeline**.

At the core of the system is an **ECS Fargate service** that runs containerized microservices. All AWS infrastructure components—including networking, security, compute, storage, and monitoring—are provisioned through **Terraform modules**. The project integrates **AWS CodeBuild** and **AWS CodePipeline**, allowing application updates to be automatically built, containerized, pushed to **Amazon ECR**, and deployed to ECS whenever new code is pushed to **GitHub**.

To balance security and cost, the system operates within **private subnets without a NAT Gateway**. Instead, it uses a collection of **VPC Interface Endpoints** (ECR, S3, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch, etc.) to allow ECS tasks to securely pull images and access required AWS services without exposing resources to the public internet.

**Security is reinforced at multiple layers:**

- **AWS WAF** protects the Application Load Balancer (ALB) from common web exploits.

- **Amazon GuardDuty**, **VPC Flow Logs**, and **CloudWatch** provide continuous threat detection and visibility.

- **Secrets Manager** is used to store sensitive credentials such as database passwords.

- **Route 53** provides custom domain management and DNS routing.

This project demonstrates a **modern, cloud-native, and production-aligned approach** to running microservices on AWS—combining **automation, observability, high availability, and strong security practices**.

This this the architecture of the project:
